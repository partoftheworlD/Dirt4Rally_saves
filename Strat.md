Intercontinental Series (R5 Skip E3) | Skip E3  Because fog. **It is mandatory to be in 1st place in 1 event, otherwise the skip won't work.** It is possible to skip one of events 2 or 3 I prefer to skip 3 as the first 3 races take place in fog and it is probably slower than driving in snow
Global Rally Series End (R5 Skip E3, E4, E5) | **It is mandatory to be in 1st place in Events 1 and 2, otherwise the skip won't work. For some reason, if you skip stage 1 or 2, you don't end up finishing the Global Rally Series in top 3** The other 3 can be skipped.
